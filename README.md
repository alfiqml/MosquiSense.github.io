Vector Borne Disease Prediction Using Naive Bayes Algorithm

# Introduction
This is my final year project for Bachelor Of Computer Science (Hons.). Implementation of machine learning in healthcare sector has risen exponentially and slowly become crucial in real-world application. Machine learning
has gained more attention nowadays due to its ability to utilize available data.
Interpretability of model predictions is noted by clinical providers and other
healthcare decision-makers as a priority for implementation and utilization (Ambekar
et al., 2018). Machine learning also is expected to reach the level where it can help
healthcare workers in managing the data more efficient. These technologies have the
ability to improve patient safety and provide clinical care, including diagnosis and
treatment while cutting costs. The development of machine learning can "empower"
clinical diagnosis in healthcare facilities and provide community practitioners with
"academician level medical ability" (Rongqiang et al., 2020). This demonstrates that
with the use of machine learning, it is possible to improve disease prediction while
also giving a beneficial method that can assist the healthcare sector and even rookie
doctors.

# Objectives
a. To train Naïve Bayes algorithm in predicting Vector-Borne disease
b. To develop a disease prediction system for diagnosing Vector Borne
diseases using Naïve Bayes.
c. To evaluate the functionality of the disease prediction system.
